This project was to explore the signal processing domain of computer science. The idea was to take some musical instrument sounds as input and process it. The program would then output a human readable file like guitar tablatures for example.

While doing this project, I had the opportunity to learn much about how sound data is formatted and processed. I also had the chance to learn more about sampling this kind of data to obtain enough information to reconstruct a human readable format of the data received.

We created this demo using Python and we got the audio data using the PyAudio plug in. We also used MATLAB to verify the mathematical functions used to process the data and converted them to numpy and scipy plug ins afterwards.

Since this project was done in a university course, I had to present the results and development process to some other people. Here is a [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t87yUucCilL57lS2pW6dBBzO64etUzkDlxKDM9hktQg/edit?usp=sharing) to the presentation used in class at the end of the project.
