When I started discussing at work that I would like to start building more experience with different game engines, I had a very good opportunity to do so around May 2020. I was offered to work on a large project that is in LiveOps mode. I was put on a team that took care of the Stadia port of Dead By Daylight.

Working on this size of project brought a lot of new knowledge as well as some experience with Unreal Engine 4. I was also very happy that I could do some graphics programming related work on the project. Since we were working on the Stadia platform, we needed to use the Vulkan rendering engine since this is what runs on the Stadia servers to render the frames to be streamed to the player afterwards. There was some bugs I had to fix with the Vulkan pipeline, for example: there was an issue with video playback where the gamma correction was not applied properly and the videos would play way darker than they should of.

We also had the chance to work with some people from the Stadia team to help us implement some of the Stadia features and to make sure the game is optimized for the platform. Since this platform is very different from all the others, there were some details to make sure we get right to produce the best experience possible.

I also worked on input handling since there were some reporting functions we needed to send to Stadia for each input sent to the server to write some text in boxes in the UI.

Here is a link to the [launch trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0CmSN3W8I4) for the port of the game.

Here's also a link to show some of the [gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ano0c8n0fhU) found in the game.
