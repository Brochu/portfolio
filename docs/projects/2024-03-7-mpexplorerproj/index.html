Now that I can move around the game world map and explore maps for the different levels, I would like another application that would let the use explore the rooms themselves in the first person.<p>At the same time, I would like to use some different tools for this project with the challenges I had to overcome with the interactive map project. Here are some differences I am planning:<ul><li>Use Microsoft's C++ compiler through the VS Developer Powershell (CL.exe) w/ CMake<li>Use <a href=https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL>SDL2</a> in order to handle inputs and window creation<li>Use <a href=https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/raddebugger>RAD Debugger</a> in order to debug issues as the project evolves<li>Use <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger>WinDbg</a> to capture DirectX12 debug layer outputs</ul><p>I am still in the starting steps of this project, but I already have some idea of the features I would like to handle :<ul><li>First person camera controls (WASD + mouse)<li>Render rooms for one level selected <ul><li>Maybe look into some dynamic loading algo to only show rooms in a given range around the player</ul><li>Render objects in the rooms as well <ul><li>Maybe look into rendering VFX</ul><li>Implement rendering motion vectors in order to unlock effects that require reprojection <ul><li>Used to implement TAA at a later stage</ul><li>Look into some effects using DXR if possible with the models (reflections?)<li>Look into having GPU driven rendering with some culling<li>Going with bindless model for the renderer<li>Trying my hand at using C-style C++ to see how I like it</ul><p>I will come back with screenshots whenever I have something ready to show, please come back for updates</div></div></main><script crossorigin integrity=sha384-k6d4wzSIapyDyv1kpU366/PK5hCdSbCRGRCMv+eplOQJWyd1fbcAu9OCUj5zNLiq src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.5/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script>
