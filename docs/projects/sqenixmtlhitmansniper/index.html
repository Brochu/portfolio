I got in the team and I had to get familiar with the game systems as a whole since I would be part of the efforts to fix bugs found in the game by the QA team.<p>During this internship, I was brought up to speed on the different systems implemented in the game so I can fix bugs. I had to look at bugs found in:<ul><li>AI System: I had to look into some issues where the AI characters would not react properly when a visual event would happen in front of them.<li>Animation system: I had to look into some issues with animation transitions that would appear strange. There were also some issues when the characters were switched from the animation mode to ragdoll physics mode.<li>Scoring system: Some bonuses weren't being added properly for actions taken while in a level<li>UI system: I have to apply some changes to some screens as the feedback was coming in.</ul><p>Here are some links to download and play the game:<ul><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareenixmontreal.hitmansniperandroid&hl=en_CA&gl=US">Android Google Play Store</a><li><a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hitman-sniper/id904278510>Apple App Store</a></ul><p>Here's also a link to show some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bByaDGi7SlI">gameplay</a> found in the game.</main><script crossorigin integrity=sha384-k6d4wzSIapyDyv1kpU366/PK5hCdSbCRGRCMv+eplOQJWyd1fbcAu9OCUj5zNLiq src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.5/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script>
