One of my friends introduced me to Super Monkey Ball a while back and I found the game to be very entertaining. Usually when I find a good game, I try to figure out the mechanics and how it is done technically. I also try to single out why is the game fun and what makes it good. Since I spent a lot of time figuring out those details about this game, I had an idea of how to start my own spin on the base idea.<p>When I started this project I already worked with the Unity engine when I worked at Square Enix Montreal, my choice to use this tool was to improve using Unity at the same time. The good thing is i worked for some time with C# now and I am comfortable with the language. This way I can concentrate in learning the good practices in Unity and create an enjoyable experience for players.<p>First I wanted to create a simple example of camera control to mimic the effect of moving the entire stage to move the ball. When I succeeded and showed the results to some of my friend, they were quickly interested in the concept so I was happy with the results.<p>As of now, I am still building mechanics and systems to be used in this game so it is still a project that is in progress. Here are the features that are in a usable state in the project as of now:<ul><li>3D character setup with a robot model found online for prototyping.<li>3D animations that are linked with some gameplay values blend spaces with player speed to blend between walk/run animations.<li>Some shader work to render the ball around the character with easy to change parameters.<li>Asset packaging setup based on asset bundles for characters, levels and worlds.<li>Camera setup that will rotate around the player.<li>Skybox asset used to give the idea that the player is found in space.<li>Movement system based on the <code>Super Monkey Ball</code> video game for the Nintendo Gamecube.<li>A very simple test scene with a slope to test physics.</ul><p>If you are interested in trying out the movement mechanics of the game, here is a <a href=https://brochu.github.io/portfolio/projects/mazewithballphysics/%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/downloads/mkb-demo.zip>download link</a> to a windows executable. If you would like to try out this on Linux or Mac, please contact me.</div><div class=mt-5><h2>Project Gallery</h2><div class="carousel slide mt-4 pb-5" id=img-carousel><div class=carousel-indicators><button aria-label="Slide 1" aria-current=true class=active data-bs-slide-to=0 data-bs-target=#img-carousel type=button></button><button aria-label="Slide 2" data-bs-slide-to=1 data-bs-target=#img-carousel type=button></button><button aria-label="Slide 3" data-bs-slide-to=2 data-bs-target=#img-carousel type=button></button><button aria-label="Slide 4" data-bs-slide-to=3 data-bs-target=#img-carousel type=button></button><button aria-label="Slide 5" data-bs-slide-to=4 data-bs-target=#img-carousel type=button></button><button aria-label="Slide 6" data-bs-slide-to=5 data-bs-target=#img-carousel type=button></button></div><div class=carousel-inner><div class="carousel-item active"><img class="d-block w-100" alt=... src=https://brochu.github.io/portfolio/imgs/projs/MkbClone_1.png></div><div class=carousel-item><img class="d-block w-100" alt=... src=https://brochu.github.io/portfolio/imgs/projs/MkbClone_2.png></div><div class=carousel-item><img class="d-block w-100" alt=... src=https://brochu.github.io/portfolio/imgs/projs/MkbClone_3.png></div><div class=carousel-item><img class="d-block w-100" alt=... src=https://brochu.github.io/portfolio/imgs/projs/MkbClone_4.png></div><div class=carousel-item><img class="d-block w-100" alt=... src=https://brochu.github.io/portfolio/imgs/projs/MkbClone_5.png></div><div class=carousel-item><img class="d-block w-100" alt=... src=https://brochu.github.io/portfolio/imgs/projs/MkbClone_6.png></div></div><button class=carousel-control-prev data-bs-slide=prev data-bs-target=#img-carousel type=button><span aria-hidden=true class=carousel-control-prev-icon></span> <span class=visually-hidden>Previous</span></button><button class=carousel-control-next data-bs-slide=next data-bs-target=#img-carousel type=button><span aria-hidden=true class=carousel-control-next-icon></span> <span class=visually-hidden>Next</span></button></div></div></div></main><script crossorigin integrity=sha384-k6d4wzSIapyDyv1kpU366/PK5hCdSbCRGRCMv+eplOQJWyd1fbcAu9OCUj5zNLiq src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.5/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script>
