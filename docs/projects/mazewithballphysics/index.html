One of my friends introduced me to Super Monkey Ball a while back and I found the game to be very entertaining. Usually when I find a good game, I try to figure out the mechanics and how it is done technically. I also try to single out why is the game fun and what makes it good. Since I spent a lot of time figuring out those details about this game, I had an idea of how to start my own spin on the base idea.<p>When I started this project I already worked with the Unity engine when I worked at Square Enix Montreal, my choice to use this tool was to improve using Unity at the same time. The good thing is i worked for some time with C# now and I am comfortable with the language. This way I can concentrate in learning the good practices in Unity and create an enjoyable experience for players.<p>First I wanted to create a simple example of camera control to mimic the effect of moving the entire stage to move the ball. When I succeeded and showed the results to some of my friend, they were quickly interested in the concept so I was happy with the results.<p>As of now, I am still building mechanics and systems to be used in this game so it is still a project that is in progress. Here are the features that are in a usable state in the project as of now:<ul><li>3D character setup with a robot model found online for prototyping.<li>3D animations that are linked with some gameplay values blend spaces with player speed to blend between walk/run animations.<li>Some shader work to render the ball around the character with easy to change parameters.<li>Asset packaging setup based on asset bundles for characters, levels and worlds.<li>Camera setup that will rotate around the player.<li>Skybox asset used to give the idea that the player is found in space.<li>Movement system based on the <code>Super Monkey Ball</code> video game for the Nintendo Gamecube.<li>A very simple test scene with a slope to test physics.</ul><p>If you are interested in trying out the movement mechanics of the game, here is a <a href=https://brochu.github.io/portfolio/projects/mazewithballphysics/%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/downloads/mkb-demo.zip>download link</a> to a windows executable. If you would like to try out this on Linux or Mac, please contact me.</main><script crossorigin integrity=sha384-k6d4wzSIapyDyv1kpU366/PK5hCdSbCRGRCMv+eplOQJWyd1fbcAu9OCUj5zNLiq src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.5/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script>
