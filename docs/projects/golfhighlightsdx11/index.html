In this game, players have access to a special widget in the UI to help make every shot as perfect as it can be. Here is an example of the said widget:<p>[<img src="https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/154451-mario-golf-toadstool-tour-gamecube-screenshot-wario-putting.png
">](Terrain Highlight Grid from Toadstool Tour)<p>As we can see, the grid is rendered on top of the terrain and will show the features of this part of the course. The grid's colors are selected with a lerp based on the terrain's height at that point. Red means the terrain is higher, blue means it is lower.<p>We cannot really see with an image, but the grid's lines are also animated to show the difference in heights between 2 neighbour points.<p>As of now, I just started the project structure and included the Dx11 SDK files. I also started making a list of the features I will need to implement for this demo. I am also looking into how I am going to dynamically generate the vertex data to render the grid.<ul><li>We will use vertex color data to store the height, we can then decode this information to feed into the color lerp.<li>This resulting color will be used to tint a texture on the grid lines<li>This texture is used to be able to animate the lines <ul><li>Texture UVs offset to give the effect of points moving along the lines<li>Texture UVs tiling to make the points closer or farther from each other</ul></ul><p>Stay tuned for more updates on this project and screenshots!</main><script crossorigin integrity=sha384-k6d4wzSIapyDyv1kpU366/PK5hCdSbCRGRCMv+eplOQJWyd1fbcAu9OCUj5zNLiq src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.5/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script>
